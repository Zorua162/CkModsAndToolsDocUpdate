Scripting rules on next page below 

Scripting in Skyblock and Survival Rules 
*also allowed in creative for fast block breaking/placing, and testing of survival scripting. 

This document statement aims to clearly define the rules regarding what actions scripts, macros, and autoclickers may perform for AFK and non-AFK players. Please Note: An AFK player is defined as a player account in which a real person is not actively intervening, not simply a player that is marked as AFK.

What actions a script/macro/autoclicker may perform with a player who is not actively intervening (an AFK player):
Any actions that can be done by putting a weight on a key or mouse (not including buttons that run actions provided by mods), such as holding right click for an AFK fish farm
Pressing a mouse button or key on a timer, such as swinging a sword every few seconds, as this can be done without mods by using vanilla minecraft and OS settings
If you have multiple keys being held or on a timer, the order in which they are pressed with a script should not affect the output.
Only one script per account and one "timer" is allowed, but other keys that perform continuous actions (such as holding, eating, moving forward continuously) may be held down at the same time.
The action performed by the script must be the same at each tick of the timer

What actions a script/macro/autoclicker may perform with a player who is actively intervening:
Everything an AFK player is allowed to do
Interactions with already open inventories/GUIs (the player must open the inventory/GUI themself, the program cannot do it) - This includes actions like crafting, trading, and sorting inventories
Press buttons that run actions provided by mods (such as Item Scroller)
The goal here is to allow scripts/macros/autoclickers that make crafting, trading, and other GUI manipulations more convenient, but to make them not completely AFKable.

What actions a script/macro/autoclicker may NOT perform, regardless of whether the player is actively intervening:
Auto movement or rotating of the player (holding down movement keys is OK, as is setting these actions on a timer according to AFK player rules. However, any movement/rotation that cannot be accomplished this way is not allowed)
Reading the minecraft state or minecraft logs (receiving data from the game unless explicitly allowed)
Automatically opening inventories or GUIs without player input
Execute another script that interacts with the game
Inputting commands
Anything else not specifically allowed

Other considerations:
Ask staff about any other function of scripts/macros/autoclickers you think should be on this list
We will allow these rules as long as they aren’t abused. These rules are subject to change. 

Reasoning/ intents of this change:
Minecraft is a game that is meant to be played by a player not scripts/ bots
We want the experience to be best for players who are actively playing
To keep gameplay considerate and fair to all players, regardless of scripting or modding knowledge
